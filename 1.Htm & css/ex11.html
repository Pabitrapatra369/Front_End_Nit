    <p>Maruti Suzuki India Limited (formerly Maruti Udyog Limited) is the Indian subsidiary of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corporation. As of September 2022, the company had a leading market share of 42 percent in the Indian passenger car market.[8] The Government of India established Maruti Udyog Limited in February 1981 as a joint venture with Suzuki Motor Corporation as a small partner.
