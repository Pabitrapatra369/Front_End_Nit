                        **HTML**
web tech
   1.Frontend Tech(html, css, js)-Client side
   2.Backend Tech(advJava,asp.net)-Server Side

Web Site:-
what is websites?
-website is a collection of information
-website is a collection of "webpages"
-webpage is a group of html elements
-element is nothing but heading , para, img, button, textbox, password, checkbox, radio, div, table, link, audio, video etc...
-using html tags we can create elements	
-collection of websites/web applications represented as "WWW"
-World wide web is represents group of connected servers(processing server, db server, mail server, proxy server, dns server...)

**Web Page**
Two Types
1)Static
	-Static pages always show same data. means user-user, time-time, place-place 
         it not changing the data automatically.
	www.abc.com-Siva, ram, Sam- same
		   -7am, 7pm- same
		   -Hyderabad, USA, UK 
	-Frontend tech points
        
2)Dynamic
	-Dynamic pages always changing/updating
		means user-user, time-time, place-place its changing data
  		automatically.
	-Backend tech points
Types of computer
  Based on performance and storage capacity
	1.mini
	2.micro(out laptop)
	3.mainframe
	4.super
  Based on working style
	1.Analog
	2.Digital(out laptop)
	3.Hybrid
Server: 
-------
	-it is a super computer
	-a server stores all the data associated with the websites that are hosted by it and share that info    with all computers and mobile devices (Clients) that need to access them.

Client:
-------
	-it is device
	-which device are supporting to access data available in server (browsing/ surffing).
	-mobile, laptop, car, washing machine, TV, robo mopping......
	-its a media/interface between server & end-user 
end-user:
---------
	-who are working on/operating client device those are called as "end-user".
www -web:
---------
	-1989/90 (Tim Berners-Lee father of web)
	-Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the "web" while at CERN, the European Physics Laboratory, in1989.
	-He wrote the first web client and server in 1990.

 	-Tim=>Web, HTML, WWW, W3C Org, http 
W3C Org:
--------
	The World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) develops standards and guidelines to help everyone build a web based on the principles of accessibility, internationalization, privacy and security.

*********************************** HTML INTRODUCTION *********************************************
	
1.HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993-dec(HTML1.0)
			GML => SGML => HTML(for web)  *** =>DHTML =>XML(for android) =>XHTML =>WML =>UML
			90     91      93/94
GML-generalized markup language
SGML-standard generalized markup language
HTML-hypertext markup language

2.html is not a programing language, but it is a markup(structure of the program) language.
3.Markup represents "tag" ,html is a tag oriented program.
4.no case restrictions (we type program either in lower or upper or mixed case)
5.Error free program , except while working url, address.
6.cross platform compactable (write once run anywhere).
7.no need to download & install any software
       typing & saving =>notepad
       execute & o/p =>browser
8.html used to develop "static web page"
9.execution is top to bottom order
10.its interpreter oriented program
=>interpreter used to translate the code from high level to machine code .
it trans code line-line & executes code line-line
				
			step1 =>trans=>exe=>o/p
			step2 =>trans=>X
			step3
11.browser is html translator & executor

**********tags***********
         ------
-it is a predefine program, set of instruction(command) (and tags are part of the browser only)
-these instruction/command are followed by browser, then produces outputs
-its an English word, every tag must be enclosed  with in < >
 
Two Types:
	1.paired tags(60%)
	 -pair means open tag & closing tag
	 -Syn:  <tag>data</tag>
	 -Ex:   <button>Login</button>
		<p>...</p>
		<h1>...</h1>
		<table>...</table>
		<audio>...</audio>
	2.unpaired tags(40%)
	 -unpair means only open tag
	 -Syn:  <tag> or<tag/>
	 -Ex:   <br/>
		<hr/>
		<img/>
		<link/>
		<meta/>
	-these are also known as self closed tags
	-also known as body less tags

structure of HTML
-----------------
as per W3C Org we have to follow the following structure to design web pages(but it's not compulsory) .

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en"> ---------------webpage /document designing starts here
 <head>
  .......
 </head>
 <body>
    welcome to the web world !
 </body>

</html>-----------------------web page /document designing ends here 

generally , html program contains three parts, those are:

 >versioning section
	
 >head section
 >body section
>versioning section
 this is providing information to the browser which version we are using  in the web page/program. So, browser is interpretation code and producing output as per given specification.

Syn:   <!DOCTYPE html version-url>

	Documentation type -library 
HTML 4.0:
 
<!DOCTYPE html public"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"
"http://www.w3c.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

<!DOCTYPE html>  ------------------use current version of HTML
current version is html 5.0

>Head Section:
	-it contains web page settings code & configuration code 
	-these 6 tags are available for the head section
	Ex: title, link ,base, style, script, meta tags
>Body Section:
	-it contains web page designing code
	Ex:h1,p,table,button, input, a, img, br, ol, ul etc...

comments in html
	-comment lines are to provide some description about our program.
	-comments are not executed by browser.
        Syn:
	 <!--comments -->

     Ex:<h1>Hypertext Markup Language</h1>
	<h2>Hypertext Markup Language</h2>
	<h3>Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
	<h4>Hypertext Markup Language</h4>
	<h5>Hypertext Markup Language</h5>
	<h6>Hypertext Markup Language</h6>
	<h7>Hypertext Markup Language</h7>
p tags:
>p stands for paragraph.
>this tags is used to display/ print more lines of text(paragraph)
>its paired tag and block level.

List tags:
---------
there is two types of list tags these are 
    1.ol(ordered list)
	2.ul(unordered list)
ol:(ordered List)
