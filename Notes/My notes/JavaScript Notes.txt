What is Scripting ?
------------------
 >A script is program code that doesn’t need pre-processing (e.g. compiling) before being run. In
 the context of a Web browser, scripting usually refers to program code written in JavaScript that
 is executed by the browser when a page is loaded, or in response to an event triggered by the
 user.

Client-side script:
------------------
>These scripts are getting executed within the web browser(client).
>Here we don't need any software.
>these scripts are used for client-side validatinos(data verification & data validations)
	Ex: JavaScript, VBScript, typescript etc..
Server-side script:
------------------
>A script which executes in server machine with support of the web-server/app-server software’s like IIS(Internet information services), Tomcat, JBOSS, etc.
>These scripts are used for server-side validations (authentication & authorization).
 Ex: php, jsp, asp.net, VueScript, Express Script, nodeJS, cgi, perl etc…
JavaScript Introduction
-----------------------
>In 1995 javaScript was created by a Netscape(Mozilla) developer named "Brendan Eich".
 			
		Mocha(1995) --> LiveScript -->JavaScript(1997-dec)
>Netscape first introduced a JavaScript interpreter in Navigator 2.

Why is it called  JavaScript ?
---------------------------------
--> WhenJavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java
 was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language
 as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
 But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own
 specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
 JS ES
 Later JavaScript became an ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association
 Script) standard in 1997. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
 ✔JavaScript is implementation of ES; ES is the specification of JavaScript.

 ES JS Programmer
--->JavaScript is a Speed, light weight, Interoperability, Extended Functionality, dynamic, loosely typed, cross platform, free ware and open-source.
	Speed->ja applications runs faster than...
	light weight->less code more operations
	Interoperability-> JavaScript they have the capability to work within other web technologies
	Extending Functionality->lib ->live
	Dynamic typed->with out declaring vars we use can directly
	loosely typed->defined any var in JS, that allows to store any type value
	cross platform->cross platform compatible
>Its single threaded programme
>JavaScript is an object-based or prototype-based programming.
	-Oops
>javaScript is client-side(browser-side)  programming. That means its executes on the browser.
>It can  also be used in server-side by using Node, ASP, PHP
>JavaScript is a case sensitive programme(mixed case)
>To work with  JavaScript, we don't need to install any software.
>JavaScript is "Interpreter-based" programming, means the code will be converted into machine language line-by-line. JavaScript interpreter is already embedded in Browsers.

How many ways to imp js?
--------------------------
>inline scripting
	onclick, on submit,
	<tag event="js code" event="js" event="js">
>internal scripting
  <head>/<body>
	<script type="text/javaScript">
	  js code
	</script>
  </head>/<body>
>external scripting
	<script src="filename.js"></script>
	
	
function defination syn:
------------------------
function fun-name()
{
     statements
}
calling syn:
   fun-name(); <-html inline or internal script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>JS->lib->collecection of predefined programs
reserved words,operations,functions,methods,classes and objects(implicit)

>object is an instance(dynamic memory block for the specified class) of class( copy of class)
>object is a collection of properties & methods

"window" is the base object for all JS objects	
	"window" object used to interacting with browser windows to perform some operations.
	>it is implicit object
"document" is the sub object of window.
	"document" object used for interacting with web page/web documents to perform some operations.
	syn:	window.document     or   documents
"console" is the sub object of window.
	"console" object used for interacting with browsers console to perform some operations.
	syn:	window.console      or   console
	press F12 key
	
JavaScript Printing methods:
-----------------------------
write() method:The  write() method writes HTML expressions or javaScript code to a document without line breaking.
syn:	window.document.write(val1,val2,val3......);
writeln() method:The write() method writes HTML expressions or javaScript code to a document with line breaking.
syn:	window.document.writeln(val1,val2,val3......);
log() method:The log() method writes HTML expressions or javaScript code on  browser's console(press F12 key)with line break.
syn: window.console.log(val1,val2,val3...);

some important points on javaScript
-----------------------------------
>we can use all  above methods without "window".
>there is no need of semicolon at the end of every statement because semicolon is optional.
>js is case sensitive.
>javaScript is always shows error but error shows in the console
>if error is there then it skips from error line up to script tag(type error)
>in some cases the total script tag is going to thrown out(Syntax error).
>you can't use direct html tags in javaScript but you can use with  the help of literal


literals
----------
#5 type of literals are in javaScript
->string literal("" and '') 
		-string literal is used to represent string/text.
		-js1 
		-SL supports one line of text.
		-not supports interpolation.
		-"" or '' both are same in javaScript.
->template literal(``---backtick)
		-string literal is used to represent string/text.
		-since js6 (ES).
		-TL supports N lines.
		-it supports interpolation.

Working with varibales
----------------------
>variable is a reference name fo a memory block.
>variables are created or stored in RAM (stack area).
>variables are used to store/to hold a value for reuse purpose and automatically substritute values in steps.

RAM
----
JS Runtime Area
>Stack Area (variables, params, Current Run code )
>Heap Area	(array, objects, funs)
>Class/Method Area( class, constructor, static items )
>Register Area (sceduling the programs is happen in this  area)
How to declare a variable ?
---------------------------
> we can define vars in js Three ways, those are:
	>by using "var"
		Syn: var varname; <-declaration
				or
			var varname=value; <-initialization
	>by using "let"(since js6)
		Syn: let varname; 
				or
			let varname=value; 
	>by using "const"(since js6)
		Syn: const varname=value; <-initialization

Where do we declare variables >

>We can declare varibles in open script tag(global), within function(local) or within block (block level)

Rules for variables naming
---------------------------
>Name should start with an alphabet (a to z or A to Z), underscrore(_), or dollar( $) sign.
>After the first claracter we can use digits(0 to 9)
>Variables are case sensitive. For example , a and A are different variables.
>Space is not allowed, means name should be a single word.
>Special chars( symbol ) are not allowed in name, except _and $.

Rules for variable in javaScript
--------------------------------
>var let support modification const not support modification and you have to initialize at the time of declaration.
>var support redefinition but not let.
>var support hoisting but not let.

			    	var      let    const
declaration			Y		Y		N
assignign			Y		Y  		N
initialization		Y		Y		Y
modification		Y		Y		N
version				Js1		ES(6)	ES(6)

difference
		var								let
>global/external Js	            >local, block level
>support re-defination			>not support
>support var hoisting			>not support
>since js1						>since js6
>sir suggest to use let

declaration-allocating memory
initialization-memory allocation and storing data at same time called initialization.
assignign- storing the data for already declared variable.

---------------------------------
re-defination -declaration two 
hoisting- use before declare after
loosely typed- if we declared any variable in js we can store any type of data.
dynamically typed
------------------
>if we don't declaration any variable we can use the variable
>it stores that variable in window object.
>by defualt it take the variable as "var" bcz it is present from first version of javaScript.

JavaScript Datatype:
---------------------
In JavaScript data types are classified into the following two cat.
1.Primitive datatype
2.Non-primitive datatype

			Primitive datatype						Not-PDT
	>PDT type allow storing data directly		>reference/address
	>PDT allow us to store only 1 value at		>N values
	 a time
	>stack area									>Heap Area
	>Not shereable								>Shareable
	>These are popularly known as non-reference >reference data type
	>predefined data types						>used defined data
	>no new key word							>new keyword is available(or [] ,{}) any of the three
Primitive data types
---------------------
>>string,number,boolean,undefined,null(object)
Non-Primitive data types
------------------------
>>Array,class&oject,functions

Type of
---------
#by the use of typeof keyword you can know which type of data it is.

syn: typeof var-name
	 typeof value
--------------------------------------------------------------
const d = new Date();
>date class object created and initialize with default value and stores the address in d reference value.


JavaScript Operators
-----------------------
>Operator is a symbol (special char) and it is used to perform certain operation (task).

>Every operator is a symbol, but every symbol is not an operator.
>Every operator requires some values, those are called operands. 

Ex: a+b

Operators in JavaScript
-----------------------
There are 3 types of operator in javaScript
1.Unary -> it  requires one operands
			>increment ++
			>decrement --
1.Binary -> it  requires Two operands
			>Arithmetic  -> +,-,*,/,%,** 
			>Relational  -> >,<,>=,<=,==,!=    ,===,!==
			>Logical	 -> &&,||,!
			>Assignment  -> =
				>short hand  -> +=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**=
			>Concatenation -> +
1.Ternary -> it  requires Three operands
			>Conditional  ? :
			
			
MAIN Operator Precedence
------------------------
1) ()   			  -paranthesis
2) .  				  -dot
3) [] 				  -square bracket
4) pre ++ ,pre --
5) **                 -power
6) *,/,%              arithmetic
7) +,-   			  arithmetic
8) >,<, >= , <=  	  relational
9) ==, !=, === , !==  relational
10) =                 assignment  
11) post ++, post --

parsing
-----------
   Changing the data mode from string format to number format
>types
	1.Auto parsing(implicit)
		All type subtraction,all type of products, all type of division,increment
	2.Manual parsing(explicit)
		a.using functions
			i)parseInt();
				predefined function of window,used string based int converts into integer format.
				syn:	window.parseInt("value")
				    "100" -> 100
					"10.79"-> 10
					"rama" -> NaN(Not a Number)
			ii)parseFloat();
				predefined function of window,used string based int converts into floating format.
				syn:	window.parseFloat("value")
				    "100" -> 100
					"10.79"-> 10.79
					"rama" -> NaN(Not a Numeric)
		b.using parse operator
			-> + is parse operator
			-> Unary operator use only left side(prefix)
			syn:	+"value" or +variable
					+"10" ->10
					+"10.56" ->10.56
					+"ram" ->NaN
					
dilog boxes in JS
-----------------
>alert box -> used to display data to user
				syn: window.alert(data)

>confirm box ->used to take the confirmation (cross check) from user.
				syn:window.confirm(data)
				
>prompt box ->used to take the input from user .
				syn: window.prompt(data)
	
Events
------
onclick
oninput --at typing change will happen

controll statement
------------------
Anonymous block
	{
	   steps
	}
if/else/for/while/do/addition
	{
		steps
	}
	if => true block
	else =>false block
	
>if is decision making
>switch is selection
>switch support all the  datatype. switch(day){}
>case can be variable also in javaScript.

Loops
------
-while loop (top testing/entry level)
-for loop 
-do-while (bottom testing /exit level )
	Initval - where the loop start/begins	i=1
	Condition - where the loop ends			i<=10
	Stepping - loop updater					i++
	
Unconditional statements
------------------------
>if condition is cumpulsory
break;		stops the whole code (loops,switch )
continue;	stops the current iteration (loops )
return;		return  from whole code 
	
String interpolation
--------------------
>string interpolation replaces the expressions in the string with actual values of the specified variables.
>substritute dynamically var/expr/fun-call in between strings
>operator is ${}
>string should be enclosed with in "backtick"(``),but not"" and''.
syn: ${var}		${expr}		${fun call}
	`text${var}text	${expr}text	${fun call}...`
	
use:while printing data & assigning values to variable.
	
Arrays
--------
>array is collecection of elements (values).
>storing group of value with  same refname is called array.
>array allows similar type of values (homogeneous ) as well as different types of  values, means one array can store group number , strings, booleans etc ....
>we can create arrays in local scope or outer scope.
>arrays are belongs to reference/non-primitive datatype.
>arrays are created dynamically, and arrays are created in heap area.
>arrays maintance data in sequence order

adv:
-----
>arrays are simplyfying coding when work with group of values.
>easy transporting data.
>also used for data maintenance in applications.

array creation:
---------------
Approach 1:
	using array Literals[ ]
	syn:	let/var/const array=[];											//declaration
			let/var/const array=[val1,val2,val3......];						//initialization
			
Approach 2:
	using new keyword & constructor
	syn:	var/let/const array= new Array();								//declaration
			var/let/const array=new Array(val1,val2,val3...);				//initialization
			
			
accessing array:
	array[index]
		index is a slno of  memory block, its start 0.
	set value:
		array[index]=value;
	size of array:
		array.length =>predefined property, its returns size of array
		array.length=N;   =>it reset size of array


>use const for always diclaring non primitive datatype suggestes 

Home work
---------
1.unique number  or not
2.print factors of n
3.check strong number or not

Nested Array:
--------------
	Arrays inside a array is called nested array.
const a1=[10,20,30];
const a2=[11,22,33];
		cosnt a=[a1,a2];
	
document.write(`${a}<br>`);


Error Handling in JavaScript
----------------------------
> JavaScript supports the following list of error
	syntax error
	runtime error
	logical error

Exception handling in javaScript
--------------------------------
to work with error/exception use try,catch, finally, throw keywords.
>try, catch and finally are blocks.
>throw statement.

>Try..catch statement:This statement allows you to test a block of codefor errors.The try block contains the code to be run & the catch blockcontains the code to be executed if an error occurs.

Syntax:
	try{
		code to run[break;]
	    }
	catch(ob){
		code to run if an exception occurs[break;]
		}
	finally{
		statements
		}
		
try-catch
try-finally
try-catch-finally these combinations are only possible

#List of Error:
--------------
Error name		Description
EvalError		An error has occurred in the eval() function(old var)->
RangeError		A number "out of range" has occurred
ReferenceError	An illegal reference has occurred
SyntaxError		A syntax error has occurred <-
TypeError		A type error has occurred
URIError		An error in encodeURI("uri") has occurred


Throw statement:
----------------
This statement allows to you create an exception .if you use this statement together with try catch statement, you can control program low and generate accurate error message. The 
>it is the custome error handling
Syn:		throw excep-obj;
			throw "text";
			
			
Timer Functions
---------------
setTimeout()
	callback,timer,it exe task, only once after n mi.sec
	var=window.setTimeout(task,"interval")
setInterval()
	callback,timer,it exe task, repeatedly for every n mi.sec
	var=window.setInterval(task,"interval")
clearTimeout()
	it stops/clears the timeout function
	var=window.clearTimeout(t-index)
clearInerval()
	it stops/clears the interval
	var=window.clearInerval(t-index)
	
print()
	This method display print dialog box, which is used to print the current webpage/document through selected printer.
	
	most of browser before printing page, they shows "Print preview" 
	Syn:	window.print()


Deployment
-----------
>netlify
>w3 spaces
>early packages

For in loop:
------------

for(temp-var in array/coll){ //fetching index 1 by 1
	steps a[temp-var];
	
	}
>we can use array with in for in loop.
>for in loop supports to manipulate array.
>its index based loop.

for of loop:
------------
	for(temp-var of array/coll){  //fetching elements 1 by 1
	steps temp-var;
	}
>we can't use array with in for of loop.
>for of loop not supports to manipulate array.
>its value based loop.
spread operator
---------------
>"..." is unary operator, we should use this operator as prefix.
>Its rest and spread operator.
>the spread /rest operator represents all remaining values/so on values.
>this we can use in methods and arrays.
	syn:	...array  <-spread
			...collection <-spread
>merging and coping


# merging and delete the duplicate elements in array

push:
-----
->it adds  elements into the last fo the array.
			
			eles.push(e);
			eles.focus();
function addElement(){
		let e=+tb.value;
		eles.push(e);
		tb.value="";
		tb.focus();
		}
functions in JavaScript:
-----------------------
>quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.
>for example, we need to show a message  when a visitor logs in , logs out and maybe somewhere else.
>Functions are the main "building blocks" of the program. We've already seen examples of built-in functions,like alert(message),prompt(message,default) and confirm (question).
But we can create functions of our own as well.
	>function is named block; it consists group of statements
	>function is used to perform specific task/operation
Adv:
----
>Reusable means they allow the code to be called many times without repetition.
>reduce length of code.
>Easy maintenance code (readability, easy debugging and modification of code...)

>2 types 
	predefined
	userdefined
>Types of functions:
--------------------
	1.Named funs			2.Expressional Funs
	3.Arrow funs			4.IE funs/II funs(Imediate Execution /imedeate invoke funs)
We can develop functions either internal or external
		Internal =>within the script tag
		External =>in sep js file, but no script tag(any no of funs)
1.Named Functions:
------------------
by using "function" keyword we can define /develop function.
syn:
	function fun-name(parameters)  //function prototype
	{
	local declaration
	statements						//body
	return value;
	}
Where to call a function?
we can call a function , from diff places, those are 
	>frome script tag
	>from another function
	>event attribute
How to calling:
	fun-name()
	fun-name(arg1,arg2....)

   
Paremeter: we can pass arbitrary data to functions using parameters (also called function arguments).
A function can return a value back into the calling code as the result.
